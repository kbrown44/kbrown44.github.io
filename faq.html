                <p class="bulk">WolfieSync is a website where Stony Brook students and faculty can find potential collaborators for a project they’re working on. The website and application would be accessible to all students through their Stony Brook email login. Accountability would be built in by feedback post collaboration; students will also be able to attest to other students skills and talents through positive testaments, or badges, linked to their profile. It’s possible that professors can also access the site and app to find assistants, interns for outside jobs, or for a specific project. </p>
